Distance between LEDs (mid2mid) ~ 1.6cm (60 LEDs/m)
Width of LED strip = 1cm

Planned dimensions of LED matrix:

Distance between LED strips (mid2mid) = 4.5 cm (3.5 cm end2end)
23 LEDs per Strip x 1.6 cm + 2*2cm border ~ 41 cm
300 available LEDs / 23 LEDs per Strip = 13 Strips
(13 Strips + 2 Borders) x 4.5 cm ~ 68 cm
